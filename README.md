# ExampleFormEmailMVC
Example ASP.NET MVC 5 generic form application that takes user input and generates an email.  

Built from ground up to use as few  assemblies possible and reduce boilerplate code.  

#Rationale
Needed a sample project to showcase my knowledge and experience with C# and ASP.NET MVC 5. 

# *Status* 

v1.0-alpha pushed today. Minimum functionality. User will have to download code and input their email address with password to utilize the email functionality. (Security issues) 

#Future Development
Create another project that expands upon this one by creating it using React.
